The very inquisitive cookie, pretty good and very easy to make. It's an adapted version of [this recipe](https://www.loveandlemons.com/oatmeal-cookies/) (aka the first result on google when you search oatmeal cookies, but hey they call them 'perfect' so why not). I'm putting my version here, without as much bloat as other recipes always have. The main changes are adding walnuts, and replacing some sugar with honey.

#### Dry Ingredients:
 * 1 cup flour
 * 1/2 cup sugar (brown probably good but I've only tried white)
 * 1/2 tsp baking soda
 * 1/2 tsp baking powder
 * 2-ish tsp cinnamon (or more or less, I am not your mother, darling)
 * a bit of nutmeg (if you want)
 * 1/2 tsp salt
 * 1/2 cup-ish rolled oats

#### Wet Ingredients:
 * 1/2 cup (1 stick) melted butter. (Maybe try creamed butter?)
 * 1.5 egg (1 egg + a yolk)
 * 2-ish tsp vanilla extract
 * 1/4 cup-ish honey

#### Mixins:
Put whatever you want here -- raisins, cranberries, etc -- but I use walnuts.
 * 2-3 handfuls of walnuts (crush them up)

#### Instructions:
 1. Preheat oven to 350F
 2. Combine ingredients and mix until it is mixed. If you feel like washing two bowls, combine all of the dry and wet ingredients separately and then add the wet to the dry, but you will still make an edible product if you just mix all of the stuff in one bowl.
 3. Mix in any mixins you want to mix in.
 3. Divide dough into roughly 1.5-2 inch diameter spheres and place them on baking sheets with parchment paper (probably need 2 baking sheets). Press spheres so they're a bit flatter. Makes about 15 cookies. Wet hands slightly to make dough easier to hand scoop.
 4. Bake for 11 minutes, taking them out while they still look a little undercooked in the center, but the edges are browning.
